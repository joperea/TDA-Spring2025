# Demo 2: Computing Persistent Homology of Filtered Complexes

## Outline

The goal for this activity is to get comfortable computing persistent homology, specifically using Ripser. At the end, there will be three mystery data sets; what topological spaces were they sampled from?


## Installing dependencies

We will use three more packages in addition to the ones you have installed thus far.

```
pip install cython ripser plotly
```
