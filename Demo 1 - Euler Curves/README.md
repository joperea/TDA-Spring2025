# Demo 2: interactive class on classification with Euler curves

## Outline

We will follow the notebook `Euler_Characteristic_curves_on_TOSCA.ipynb`


## Installing dependencies

We will use three more packages in addition to the ones you have installed thus far.
First, activate the course's conda environment
```
conda activate TDA
```

and then run

```
pip install bokeh pymeshlab hirola
```

## Getting the files

You have three options:

1. Clone the github repository using git:
```
git clone https://github.com/joperea/TDA-Spring2023.git
```
If you had previously cloned it, you can just do `git pull origin main` from the root of the repository to download the new files.

2. Download the files manually by clicking on them, then on "raw", and then right click > save as. Remember to change the .txt extension to the suitable extension (.ipynb for jupyter notebooks and .py for python files).

3. Download a zip with the entire repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/joperea/TDA-Spring2023/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
